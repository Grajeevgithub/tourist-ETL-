# 🌍 Tourist Data ETL & Analysis Project

This project presents a complete **Data Engineering and Analysis pipeline** for tourism data using **Python, MySQL, and Power BI**.  
It automates data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and visualization — delivering deep insights into bookings, transport modes, and yearly travel trends.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build an end-to-end pipeline that:
- Extracts data from a **MySQL database**
- Cleans, transforms, and stores it efficiently in **Parquet format**
- Analyzes tourism metrics like routes, bookings, and transport usage
- Predicts future trends using **machine learning models**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Python** (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- **MySQL** (Data Source)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard & KPIs)
- **ETL Automation** (via Ubuntu / WSL)
- **Machine Learning** (Random Forest for forecasting)

---

## ✅ Key Features

- ⚙️ Automated ETL pipeline (MySQL → Parquet → Cleaned datasets)  
- 🧹 Data cleaning, EDA, and merging of multi-table relationships  
- 🧠 Predictive modeling using Random Forest  
- 🚍 Route and transport trend analysis (Bus, Train, Flight)  
- 📆 Year-wise route forecasting with visual trend charts  
- 📈 Exported reports, graphs, and model metrics  

---

## 🔍 Project Insights

- Bus routes have the **highest frequency**, followed closely by trains.  
- Average travel **duration and cost vary significantly** by mode of transport.  
- **Revenue and route activity** show clear seasonal and yearly growth trends.  
- Predictive models provide insight into **future travel demand patterns**.
